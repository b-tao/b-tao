# Hello, I'm Brian ðŸ‘‹
I'm a computer science and medical science student at Boston University, with strong interests in the intersection of Computer Science and Medicine, Applications of Machine Learning, and Full Stack Development. In my free time, I enjoy working on personal coding projects and participating in hackathons. I'm always looking for new oppurtunies, feel free to reach out to me.
